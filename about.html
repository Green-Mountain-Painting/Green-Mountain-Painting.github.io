            <h2>Rob Leitschuh, CEO</h2>

            <p>I have been in the painting business for 45 years. In those years I have seen the changes in product
                use and the new innovative products available. Because I've worked on every style of house in
                New England, I know just where and when to use these new materials to give you the most beautiful
                paint job you can get.</p>

            <p>Over these years I've worked on private homes from Victorian to Capes and Federal Houses to log
                homes that were 200-hundred years old, or brand new. I've also painted and repaired commercial
                buildings, offices, and schools. Because of this experience, I'm well versed in the problems
                and obstacles they may present to a perfect job. So, I know how to do the job right!</p>
