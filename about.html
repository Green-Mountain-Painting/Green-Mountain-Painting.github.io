<p><strong>Rob Leitschuh, CEO</strong></p>

<p>I have been in the painting business for 35 years. In those years I have seen the changes in product
    use and the new innovative products available. Because I&rsquo;ve worked on every style of house in
    New England, I know just where and when to use these new materials to give you the most beautiful
    paint job you can get.</p>

<p>Over these years I&rsquo;ve worked on private homes from Victorian to Capes and Federal Houses to log
    homes that were 200-hundred years old, or brand new. I&rsquo;ve also painted and repaired commercial
    buildings, offices, and schools. Because of this experience, I&rsquo;m well versed in the problems
    and obstacles they may present to a perfect job. So, I know how to do the job right!</p>
