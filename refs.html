<p class="quote">&quot;Painting can be an intrusive job. We had Rob paint a very tricky area with cathedral
    ceilings. When he was done, there was not a drop of paint on the floor, or on the furniture&mdash;all
    with almost no inconvenience. He also got me an electrician to put in the fan I wanted at the top of the
    cathedral ceiling. Saved me from finding one myself! &quot; - JL Post Mills, VT</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;Rob has done several projects for me over the past few years, primarily painting,
    and without exception, his work has been excellent. He has been willing and able, whenever possible, to
    work his schedule around mine and has managed his work with a minimum of disruption in my home. He has
    good suggestions and ideas and his efforts has transformed my home. He has always been reliable and his
    work is worth every penny. There is no one I trust more to do such a terrific job.&rdquo; Sara Fisher
